# AirHockey

![In-game screenshot](screenshot.png)

VRC world prefab by me and [F4celess](https://github.com/F4celess). Still WIP, but it's playable, unlike other AirHockey prefabs and worlds.

## Installation

Just drag *.unitypackage into your world project, than drag prefab into your scene. Same for updating.

In GameManager script, you can change max amount of points before game over. Default is 7.

## Dependencies
[LightSync](https://github.com/MMMaellon/LightSync), tested on 1.5.0, but you should install the latest version avaliable in your VCC.

[TextMeshPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@3.2/manual/index.html), Unity will prompt you to install it if it isn't.
